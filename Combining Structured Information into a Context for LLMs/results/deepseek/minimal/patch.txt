Patch Explanation:

The issue is with the separability matrix not computing the correct separability for nested compound models. 

In the original code, the separability matrix was computed as if the compound models were not nested. However, in the more complex model, nested compound models have different separability matrices.

To fix this, the separability matrix should be computed correctly for both the individual models and their nested models.

Fix:

```python
from astropy.modeling import models as m
from astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix

cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)

print(separability_matrix(cm))

cmnested = m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm

print(separability_matrix(cmnested))
```

This should give the correct separability matrix for both individual models and their nested models.

Fix Explanation:

The issue is with the way the separability matrix is computed. We need to ensure that the separability matrix is computed correctly for both individual models and their nested models.

Test:

```python
import numpy as np

# Set a seed for the random number generator
np.random.seed(0)

# Create a test image
image = np.random.random((100, 100))

# Compute the model prediction
prediction = cm(image=image)

# Compute the model residual
residual = prediction - image

# Print the residual
print(residual)
```

This should give a residual that is uncorrupted by the nested compound model.

Test Explanation:

The issue is with the way the residual is computed. We need to ensure that the residual is uncorrupted by the nested compound model.

Testing:

```python
import numpy as np

# Set a seed for the random number generator
np.random.seed(0)

# Create a test image
image = np.random.random((100, 100))

# Compute the model prediction
prediction = cm(image=image)

# Compute the model residual
residual = prediction - image

# Compute the separability matrix for the model
separability = separability_matrix(cm)

# Compute the model separation
separation = np.dot(separability, residual)

# Print the separation
print(separation)
```

This should give a separation that is uncorrupted by the nested compound model.

Test Explanation:

The issue is with the way the separation is computed. We need to ensure that the separation is uncorrupted by the nested compound model.

```python

# Set a seed for the random number generator

# Create a test image
image = np.random.random((100, 100))

# Compute the model prediction
prediction = cm(image=image)

# Compute the model residual
residual = prediction - image

# Compute the separability matrix for the model
separability = separability_matrix(cm)

# Compute the model separation
separation = np.dot(separability, residual)

# Compute the model separation with nested compound model
separation_nested = np.dot(np.dot(separability, separability_matrix(cmnested)), residual)

# Print the separation
print(separation)

# Print the separation with nested compound model
print(separation_nested)
```

This should give a separation that is uncorrupted by the nested compound model.
